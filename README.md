Example 1: Tic Tac Toe

How It Works:

print_board(board): Prints the game board.

check_win(board, player): Checks if the given player has won the game.

check_draw(board): Checks if the game is a draw (i.e., no empty spaces left).

get_move(): Prompts the user to input a move and ensures it's valid.

play_game(): Manages the game loop, switching between players and checking for win conditions or draws.

How to Play:

Run the script, and players will be prompted to enter their moves.

Moves are numbered from 1 to 9, corresponding to the positions on the board (1 being the top-left and 9 being the bottom-right).
